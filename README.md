A mini project to practice my React skills. My first experimentation into using APIs with React.

This really grew my confidence a lot. I have sort of done a similar project before with my walmart search scraper in python,
but that was following a tutorial and this one was largely by myself (and some LLM help for some things like syntax and
how to do CSS animation). In addition, I wasn't really confident with my async functions and useEffect(), but now I'm
feeling pretty comfortable.

Features:
Search a movie title
Displays by popular when search input is empty
Shows movie ratings, title, poster, and year.
Pagination up to page 500 (the max given the free api plan)

Used themoviedb.org api

To do:
Filtering (by genre, rating, etc)
Typescript typing
More css to make the site look pretty
Backend functionality(?)
